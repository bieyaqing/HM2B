				enables travellers to earn money, simply by helping others back home
				purchase items and carry them back using their unused luggage space.
				Travelers just need to list their itinerary here.</h4>
			<h4 class="banner-content hm2b-text-margin">For those back home,
				you do not need to wait for someone you know to travel before you
				can get what you want. Simply list your items and the city a
				traveler can get them from. Now you can purchase items that are not
				found in your country or are significantly cheaper overseas. Think
				beautiful handbags, exotic kit kat flavors or even duty-free goods.
				The possibilities are endless.</h4>
